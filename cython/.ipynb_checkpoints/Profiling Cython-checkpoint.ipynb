The most important columns here are totime (total time spent in this function not counting functions that were called by this function) and cumtime (total time spent in this function also counting the functions called by this function). Looking at the tottime column, we see that approximately half the time is spent in approx_pi and the other half is spent in recip_square.

First note, that this function is not to be called from code outside of our module; so it would be wise to turn it into a cdef to reduce call overhead. We should also get rid of the power operator: it is turned into a `pow(i,2)` function call by Cython, but we could instead just write `i*i` which could be faster. The whole function is also a good candidate for inlining (compiler optimization that replaces a function call site with the body of the callee).
